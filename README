Introduction
------------

aa-scan3 is a tool to help generate AppArmor profiles by inspecting the
executables to protect with AppArmor.

aa-scan3 is a build-time tool, not a run-time tool; its intended usage
is during build: it does not attempt to run the executable. Instead, it
scans it to generate the profile.

"Scanning" is a broad description. aa-scan3 is plugins-based, and all
plugins are presented the executable. Each plugin has its own "scanning"
method: inspecting the file for patterns, looking for associated files
on the side, etc...


Calling aa-scan3
----------------

aa-scan3 takes a set of global options, plus the options specified by
each plugins.

Run `aa-scan3 -h` for the set of options.


Writting a plugin
-----------------

Plugins must be implemented in Python 3.5, and must work with Python 3.5
or later. [TBC: where to install plugins?]

Plugins are named by their file name. E.g. a file named 'foo.py' will
declare a plugin named 'foo'. Plugin names must consist of only letters,
underscores and numbers.

A plugin must contain a docstring at the module-level, that provides
the help text for that plugin, help text that will be displayed in the
output of `aa-scan3 --help` in a section dedicated to that plugin.
